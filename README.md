Create your playlist locally and play the samples provided from Spotify.

On initialization, a browser page will open requesting a spotify login. After that, the program will check if there is a playlist file  and load it automatically.

To create a new playlist, click the playlist button and type it's name. The program will check if the name has an invalid character, is null or is already being used by other playlists of the user.

Search for the desired track on the bottom search bar field. Then, click "add to playlist" or double click it. It is only possible to add tracks with available preview and those who aren't already added on the current playlist.

The software tells if the preview is not available by highlighting it in red.

The playlist is automatically saved when a track is added or removed. 

You can play the playlist from the beginning or from a desired track. Just double click it, or select it and then press the play button. 

The current playing song will be highlighted on the playlist field  and will automatically change when other tracks are played.

A progress bar will follow the track while it is being played.
